# How to Use This Repository

#### Generate R markdown .Rmd files for each CD

The CSVs listed in the cd_todos directory files are used to generate batches of the R markdown .Rmd files that create the report cards.

From the reportcards directory, the make_sedfiles.py script creates a file of replacement editing commands to be run against the template .Rmd file to make the .Rmd for the CD.  This script also creates the make_reports.sh bash shell script the calls upon the sedfiles to do the editing for each CD.

A state_names.csv file in the cd_todos directory is also used to map the state/CD from the cds_todo_X.csv files to the full possessive state name, e.g. AL,1 --> Alabama's 1st.

  ../cd_todos/cd_todos_1.csv
  ../cd_todos/state_names_es.csv   ---> make_sedfiles.py   ---> reportcards/SEDs/sedfile_AL1.txt, etc.
  
  VA4_2020_es.Rmd
  SEDs/sedfile_XXX.txt   ---> make_reports.sh   ---> reportcards/New/AL1_2020.Rmd, etc.
  
#### Create the HTML and PDF report cards from .Rmd files

The R Markdown files in the reportcards/New directory are inputs for the runreports.R script.  For every .Rmd file
it finds in the reportcards/New directory it creates an HTML and PDF report card.

**Suggestions for additional components of Readmes:**
* A "How to use" section if the repo's project is a tool or website
* A link to the [good-first-issue](https://github.com/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Agood-first-issue+user%3Aedgi-govdata-archiving) label (this link across EDGI, or a specific link for the repo)
* Highlight "ready" label on issues to mean "this is an issue that is ready to work on and needs an owner"
* Additional badges at the top, such as code quality indicators
* "[All contributors](https://github.com/kentcdodds/all-contributors#emoji-key)" listing, following these additional guidelines (example: [web-monitoring-db contributors list](https://github.com/edgi-govdata-archiving/web-monitoring-db#contributors)):
  - Compact representation without avatars (less visual noise; easier to focus on contributions)
  - Icons are links with title attributes (accessibility)
  - Alphabetical order by surname/name/username (to eliminate implied ranking)
  - Presence in the list (and the name used) is optional and up to the contributor (not everyone wants to be listed â€” we offer, but do not add unless someone explicitly says yes)

**When using this template, please look through all of the files to ensure they apply to the new repo.**
